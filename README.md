# Comment Toxicity Model

This repository contains a comment toxicity model built using TensorFlow and Keras, aiming to predict the toxicity level of comments. The model is trained on the [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data?select=train.csv.zip).

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed and vectorized for model training.
- Model Building: Utilizes a Bidirectional LSTM neural network for toxicity prediction.
- Evaluation: Provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
- Prediction Interface: Includes a Gradio interface for users to input comments and receive toxicity predictions.

## Usage

Here is a real world example
